# LoL-Jungle-Timer
###### A League of Legends Jungling Timer for the iPad.

This project was my first attempt at iOS development. Do not expect anything fancy or any new insights.
It was just me, an iPad and an evening to play around with XCode. And what better project then to create a tool for
one of your favorite games!

This tool helps you keep track of all the jungle creeps. Just click on the icons to reset the timers or double click to set it to active.

Optimized for iOS Version 7 and League of Legends pre 5.0.
You are free to take any part of the code. Learn and enjoy!
